UNIT–1: Attacks on Computers & Computer Security


---

1. Computer Security – Introduction

Computer Security means protecting:

Data

Hardware

Software

Network


from unauthorized access, damage, or misuse.

Goals of Computer Security (CIA Triad)

Goal	Meaning

Confidentiality	Data should not be accessed by unauthorized users
Integrity	Data should not be changed without permission
Availability	Data and system should be available when needed



---

2. Need for Computer Security

Computer security is needed to:

Protect sensitive information

Prevent data theft

Prevent system damage

Ensure reliable system operation


Why security is required

Reason	Explanation

Data theft	Hackers may steal personal or company data
Data modification	Data can be altered illegally
Service disruption	Systems may stop working
Financial loss	Attacks can cause money loss



---

3. Security Approaches

Security approaches describe how security is implemented.

Types of Security Approaches

 rules, and user training



---

4. Principles of Computer Security

These principles help design a secure system.

Basic Security Principles

Principle	Explanation

Least Privilege	User gets minimum required access
Defense in Depth	Multiple layers of security
Fail-Safe Default	Access is denied by default
Accountability	Every action is traceable to a user
Confidentiality	Prevents data leakage



---

5. Attacks on Computers

An attack is an attempt to break security.

Classification of Attacks

Type	Description

Passive Attack	Attacker only observes data
Active Attack	Attacker modifies or destroys data



---

6. Passive Attacks

Passive attacks do not change data.

Types of Passive Attacks

Attack	Explanation

Eavesdropping	Listening to communication
Traffic Analysis	Analyzing communication pattern


📌 Hard to detect but easy to prevent using encryption.


---

7. Active Attacks

Active attacks modify system or data.

Types of Active Attacks

Attack	Explanation

Masquerade	Attacker pretends to be authorized user
Replay Attack	Old data is resent to gain access
Message Modification	Data is altered
Denial of Service (DoS)	System is overloaded to stop service



---

8. Common Computer Attacks

Attack	Description

Virus	Malicious program that damages files
Worm	Self-replicating program
Trojan Horse	Malicious program disguised as useful software
Phishing	Fake messages to steal user data
Ransomware	Locks data and demands money



---

9. Security Mechanisms

Security mechanisms are tools used to prevent attacks.

Types of Security Mechanisms

Mechanism	Purpose

Authentication	Verifies user identity
Authorization	Grants access rights
Encryption	Protects data confidentiality
Firewall	Filters network traffic
Antivirus	Detects and removes malware



---

10. Difference: Active vs Passive Attack

Feature	Passive Attack	Active Attack

Data modification	No	Yes
Detection	Difficult	Easier
Example	Eavesdropping	DoS attack
