## 1. Definitions of Project and Project Management

### 📌 Introduction
Project Management is the core discipline that bridges the gap between entrepreneurial ideas and tangible deliverables. It is the structured process used to achieve unique goals within specific constraints.

### 💡 Core Concepts and Definitions

#### A. Definition of a Project
A project is a **temporary endeavor** undertaken to create a **unique product, service, or result**.

* **Key Characteristics:**
    1.  **Temporary:** Has a definite beginning and a definite end (it's not ongoing).
    2.  **Unique:** Creates a deliverable that is different in some way from all similar products or services (even if the category is the same, e.g., every new bridge is a unique project).
    3.  **Specific Objectives:** Undertaken to achieve planned goals, often defined in terms of outputs, outcomes, or benefits.
    4.  **Constraints:** Bounded by the triple constraints of **Scope, Time, and Cost** (often expanded to include Quality).

#### B. Definition of Project Management
Project Management is the application of **knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques** to project activities to meet the project requirements.

* **Goal:** To achieve the project objectives while balancing the competing demands of **Scope, Time, Cost, and Quality** (the **"Triple Constraint"**).
* **Contrast with General Management:** General management is continuous and deals with ongoing operations, while project management is temporary and focused on achieving a specific, unique deliverable.

### 📊 The Triple Constraint Model


### 🔑 Important Keywords
**Temporary Endeavor**, **Unique Deliverable**, **Triple Constraint** (Scope, Time, Cost), **Acceptance Criteria**.

### ✅ Summary/Revision Points
* A project is a **temporary, unique effort** to create a specific result.
* Project Management is the **disciplined application** of processes to balance **Scope, Time, Cost, and Quality**.

## 2. Issues and Problems in Project Management

### 📌 Introduction
Even with the best planning, projects face inevitable roadblocks. Project managers must be skilled at anticipating, identifying, and mitigating these common challenges, as failure to do so is the primary cause of project delays and failures.

### 💡 Major Issues and Problems (Exam Focus)
| Category | Problem/Issue | Description & Mitigation Tip |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Scope** | **Scope Creep** (Most Common) | The uncontrolled expansion of a project's scope without adjustments to time, cost, or resources. This dilutes the budget and delays the project. |
| | **Unclear Objectives** | Project goals or success criteria are vague or not formally defined at the start. Leads to team confusion and misaligned stakeholder expectations. |
| **II. Time/Budget** | **Unrealistic Deadlines** | Timelines are imposed externally (by stakeholders) or accepted internally (by the PM) without proper estimation based on the team's capacity or the work required. |
| | **Budget Overruns** | Project expenses exceed the allocated budget, often due to poor initial estimation, scope creep, or unanticipated risks. |
| **III. Resources/Team**| **Inadequate Resource Management** | Failure to allocate the right number of people, equipment, or materials at the right time. Leads to bottlenecks, idle time, or burnout. |
| | **Lack of Accountability/Skills** | Team members lack the necessary skills for tasks, or there is no clear ownership, leading to low-quality output and missed deadlines. |
| **IV. Communication**| **Insufficient Stakeholder Engagement** | Not involving or communicating regularly with key stakeholders (clients, investors, end-users). Leads to resistance, late changes, and dissatisfaction. |
| | **Poor Communication** | Miscommunication between team members, teams, or with the client. Causes conflicts, rework, and poor decision-making. |
| **V. Risk** | **Inadequate Risk Management** | Failing to proactively identify potential threats (e.g., technical failure, regulatory change, supply chain issues) and develop mitigation strategies. |
| | **Resistance to Change** | When unavoidable changes occur (e.g., pivot in technology), the team or stakeholders resist the new direction, causing delays. |

### 🔑 Important Keywords
**Scope Creep**, **Resource Allocation**, **Stakeholder Register**, **Risk Register**, **Rework**.

### 🧠 Tips to Memorize (The Core Roadblocks)
Focus on the 4 main causes of failure, which are almost always interrelated:
1.  **Vague Scope** (Causes Creep)
2.  **Poor Planning** (Causes Unrealistic Deadlines/Budget Overruns)
3.  **Poor People Management** (Causes Resource Issues/Low Accountability)
4.  **Poor Communication** (Causes Conflicts/Misaligned Expectations)

### ✅ Summary/Revision Points
* The most damaging problems relate to **Scope Creep** and poor **Stakeholder Management**.
* **Proactive planning** (Risk Register, clear objectives, communication plan) is the only way to manage these issues.

## 3. Project Life Cycle (PLC)

### 📌 Introduction
The Project Life Cycle (PLC) is the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. It provides a structured, common-sense framework for managing complex work.

### 💡 The Four Phases of the Project Life Cycle (PLC)
The PLC is typically divided into four main sequential phases, often accompanied by a parallel "Monitoring and Controlling" process.

#### A. Initiation / Conceptualization Phase (The "Why" and "What")
* **Goal:** To formally define and authorize the project or a new phase.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Feasibility Study:** Determine if the project is technically, economically, and legally viable.
    * **Project Charter Creation:** The foundational document that formally authorizes the project, defines the high-level **scope** and objectives, and appoints the Project Manager.
    * **Stakeholder Identification:** Identifying all individuals or groups impacted by the project.
* **Deliverables:** **Project Charter**, Business Case/Feasibility Study, Stakeholder Register.
* **Key Question:** *Is the project worth doing?*

#### B. Planning Phase (The "How")
* **Goal:** To define the project objectives and scope in detail and develop the strategy for executing the work.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposing the total scope into smaller, manageable tasks.
    * **Scheduling:** Developing the project timeline (e.g., using Gantt Charts, Critical Path Method - CPM).
    * **Resource and Budget Planning:** Detailed cost estimation and resource allocation.
    * **Risk Planning:** Creating the **Risk Register** and mitigation strategies.
    * **Communication Plan:** Defining *who* needs *what* information, *when*, and *how*.
* **Deliverables:** **Project Management Plan (PMP)**, WBS, Schedule, Budget, Risk Register.
* **Key Question:** *How will we achieve the goals within constraints?*

#### C. Implementation / Execution Phase (The "Do")
* **Goal:** To carry out the work defined in the Project Management Plan to meet the project specifications.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Directing and Managing Project Work:** Leading the team and executing tasks.
    * **Procurement:** Acquiring necessary external resources, materials, or vendors.
    * **Quality Assurance:** Implementing quality checks and standards.
    * **Communication and Team Development:** Continuous stakeholder engagement and team management.
    * ***Monitoring and Control (Parallel Process):*** Tracking progress against the plan, measuring KPIs, and managing changes (**Integrated Change Control** is vital here to prevent scope creep).
* **Deliverables:** **Project Deliverables** (Prototypes, Software Modules, Constructed systems), Work Performance Data, Change Requests.
* **Key Question:** *Are we meeting the defined objectives?*

#### D. Closure / Termination Phase (The "Finish")
* **Goal:** To formally conclude the project and finalize all activities.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Obtaining Final Acceptance:** Getting formal sign-off from the client/sponsor that the product meets all acceptance criteria.
    * **Administrative Closure:** Finalizing contracts, updating records, and paying final bills.
    * **Lessons Learned:** Documenting successes, failures, and recommendations for future projects (creating the **Lessons Learned Register**).
    * **Releasing Resources:** Disbanding the project team and reassigning personnel and equipment.
* **Deliverables:** **Final Project Report**, Accepted Deliverable, Lessons Learned Register, Formal Project Sign-off.
* **Key Question:** *Is the project officially complete and the team disbanded?*

### 🔑 Important Keywords
**Project Charter**, **WBS**, **Gantt Chart**, **Critical Path Method (CPM)**, **Monitoring and Control**, **Lessons Learned**.

### ✅ Summary/Revision Points
* The PLC provides structure, moving sequentially from **defining** the project to **planning** the execution, **executing** the work, and finally **closing** the project.
* The output of the **Planning Phase** (the PMP) is the roadmap for the **Execution Phase**.

* Formal **Closure** is essential for capturing knowledge and releasing resources.
